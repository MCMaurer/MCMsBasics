# MCMsBasics

Convenience functions to help me get stuff done.

## To Do
1) Get a little more advanced with ggplot themes and color schemes. Should look at `hrbrthemes` for inspiration.
2) Do some `brms` convenience functions
  - especially look at converting my custom figure-generating functions
3) Maybe look into making your own `geom` ooooooooh
  - see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/extending-ggplot2.html)
  - find a cool visualization and try to replicate it as a `geom`
